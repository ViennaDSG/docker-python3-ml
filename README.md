# docker-python3-ml

Docker image for machine learning with [Python](http://www.python.org).
Although primarily intended to serve as the base image for VDSG's Docker image
[docker-python3-ml-interact](https://github.com/ViennaDSG/docker-python3-ml-interact)
for interactive machine learning, it may also serve for other purposes - especially for
dockerizing applications developed with [docker-python3-ml-interact](https://github.com/ViennaDSG/docker-python3-ml-interact).

The image is based on the official [Python 3.5 Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/) and provides
* numpy,
* pandas,
* scipy,
* scikit-learn,
* nltk, and
* tensorflow.
